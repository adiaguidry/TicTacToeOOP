# TicTacToeOOP

##Designed a TTT game and built it with Object Oriented Programing in JavaScript
##Scope:

- Make a tic-tac-toe game
- at least 2 players
- at least 3x3 board size
- players alternate in some way or form
- one player should be able to win (though is not guaranteed)
* Additional requirements:
* at least 2 board sizes
Dynamic win condition generation: no hard-coded if statements or data structures to determine win conditions. Such structures can be made, but must be made dynamically via code, not hand-coded in the final product.
